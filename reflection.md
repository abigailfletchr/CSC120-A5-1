- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?

At first I was definitely confused especially when I had to build an engine in the Train class, however after working with this homework I can see the differences with agregation, composition, and just association. My classes and methods in this program rely on each other or are within each other and this is a bit complex inseatd of just writing methods and writing classes, however I think when you get to higher level programming you need thid association and connection between classes. Its what "makes sense".

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I definitely needed the A5 Overview Video and after watching it became a lot more clear, however when I started and was just staring at blank Class files I got a little scared. But, going through the README instructions it was super clear what I needed to do and kinda did it well. I did need help from TA and someone who's been coding a while just to think amd talk through it.
